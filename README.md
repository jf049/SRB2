# Sonic Robo Blast 2

[Sonic Robo Blast 2](https://srb2.org/) is a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog fangame based on a modified version of [Doom Legacy](http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net/).

This fork aims to support the Nintendo Switch.

## Installation Instructions
You can find downloads in [releases](https://github.com/heyjoeway/SRB2/releases).

1. Make sure your Switch can run homebrew.
2. Extract the contents of the zip to the root of your SD card.
3. Start SRB2 via hbmenu (or whatever method you prefer).

NOTE: This game requires full RAM access. This means you can't launch hbmenu from the album applet when running this. With the latest Atmosphere build and its default config, you can hold R while starting any game to open hbmenu with full RAM access.

## Update Instructions
Extract the contents of the update patch to the root of your SD card. Overwrite any files that might conflict.

## Features
- Full online support
- Full mouse/keyboard support
- Full software keyboard support

## Notes
- I've included a config.cfg that sets the resolution to 800x450 by default. It doesn't really do anything else so you can leave it out if you'd like.
- The game takes a bit to boot. A faster SD card may help with this.
- Without a config file, the game's default resolution is 320x200. I recommend setting it to 800x450 for the best balance of performance and visuals.
- The game continues to run while on the Switch's home screen when you are unable to pause to prevent lag-switching.
- If you want to play the game with mouse/keyboard, you'll have to bind most of the buttons yourself.
- All button bindings are set "correctly" out-of-the-box. You might want to tweak them to your liking though.
